# JRis
JRis is a Kotlin implementation of RIS Format - currently forked from fastlucas Java implementation
available on [Github](https://github.com/fastluca/JRis).
JRis has the goal to give an easy way to parse RIS format stream and to build them.

From [Wikipiedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIS_(file_format)):
> RIS is a standardized tag format developed by Research Information Systems, Incorporated (the format name refers to the company) to  enable citation programs to exchange data. It is supported by a number of reference managers. Many digital libraries, like IEEE Xplore, Scopus, the ACM Portal, Scopemed, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink and Rayyan QCRI can export citations in this format. Major reference/citation manager applications, like Zotero, Mendeley, and EndNote can export and import citations in this format.
