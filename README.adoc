== KRis

KRis is a Kotlin implementation of RIS Format -- forked from fastlucas Java implementation https://github.com/fastluca/JRis[JRis].
KRis has the goal to give an easy way to parse RIS format stream and to build them.

From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIS_(file_format)[Wikipiedia]:

====
RIS is a standardized tag format developed by Research Information Systems,
Incorporated (the format name refers to the company) to  enable citation programs to exchange data.
It is supported by a number of reference managers.
Many digital libraries, like IEEE Xplore, Scopus, the ACM Portal, Scopemed, ScienceDirect,
SpringerLink and Rayyan QCRI can export citations in this format.
Major reference/citation manager applications, like Zotero, Mendeley, and EndNote can export
and import citations in this format.
