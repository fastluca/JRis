The RIS file format is one of the common formats used to exchange
date between citation managers. It was initially developed by the
commercial company Research Information Systems (RIS). It is used
by numerous citation managers and digital libraries, some of which
are e.g. Zotero or EndNote. For more details about the RIS file
format and it's history, refer to the respective 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIS_(file_format)[Wikipedia article].

JRis was initially developed by Gianluca Colaianni (fastluca) and
is available on github: https://github.com/fastluca/JRis. It was
ported to kotlin by Urs Joss (ursjoss) in a fork and is currently
in the process of being merged again with the original project.
